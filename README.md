# 👋 Hey, I'm Rj.Nlxe — Web Developer & Builder at Heart

I’m a hands-on developer who enjoys digging into code, solving real problems, and shipping useful things. I'm always looking for ways to improve how I build — cleaner code, smarter tools, better workflows.

- 💡 Always tinkering with new ideas, libraries, and patterns  
- 🧱 Building actual stuff — not just demos — and contributing where I can  
- 🧠 Focused on becoming a better **JavaScript**/**TypeScript** dev every day  
- 🌱 Diving deeper into **Next.js**, **Vue**, and **Nuxt**

## 🚀 Things I've Built

I like to learn by doing — building things that solve problems, even small ones. My repos are full of experiments, tools, and full-stack builds.

- 🧩 Custom UI kits, components, and dev tools  
- 🛠️ Helper libs, utilities, and design systems  
- 📦 Prototypes, MVPs, and full-stack apps
